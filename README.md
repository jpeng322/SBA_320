# SBA320 React Web Application Project

This skill based assessment tested my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and deployment. I used the axios library to asynchronously call the ExercsieDB API to expose data of many different exercises. I implemented React hooks to manage the state of functional components which include the filter dropdown, search bar, and workout cards.

## Usage

To filter the cards by their categories, click on the dropdown and click on the type of workout exercise you would like. 

To search the exercises, input the name of the exercise you would like.

If you would like to see all the exercises, refresh or clear out the search bar.
